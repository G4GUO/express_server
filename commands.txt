#
# This is a list of commands that can be sent to the server to adjust parameters
# They are sent by writing to a temporary file calle /tmp/expctrl
#
# This is an example of doing it from a command line
#
# echo "set level 50" >> /tmp/expctrl
#
#
# to start the server for narrowband operation 
# ./express_server -nb
# To read the transport stream from stdin
#./express_server -nb -i stdin
#
# If you have a Si570 fitted you need to add -si570 to the command line to enable it
#

# Set the transmit frequency n in Hz  echo "set freq 437000000" >> /tmp/expctrl 
set freq    n

# Set the symbol rate n in symbols per second
set srate   n

# Set the FEC rate 
set fec     {1/2,2/3,3/4,5/6,7/8}

# Set the level n from 0 to 100
set level   {0...100}

# Set the UDP transport stream socket n, this command only works from the configuration file
# datvexpress.txt

set tsock   n

# Go to transmit
set ptt tx

# Go to receive
set ptt rx

# Set the iq dc offset mode on
set iqcal on

# Set the iq dc offset mode off
set iqcal off

# Set the ical value n (normally between -20 to + 20)
set ical n

# Set the qcal value n (normally between -20 and +20)
set qcal n

# Send a plain carrier
set car  on

# Don't send a carrier
set car off

# Transmit a ramp (the ram rate is set by the symbol rate)
set ramp on

# Don't transmit a ramp
set ramp off

# Enable pre-distortion (this won't work is no table values have been loaded)
set pre  on

# Do not use pre-distotion table
set pre off

# Set an entry in the pre-distortion look table. There are 256 entries int the table 
# the first n is the entry number and the second n is the value for that entry and can be 
# between 0 and and the value is from 0 to 32767
set ptab n n

# This command kills the server process
set kill
